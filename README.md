<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS+React</strong>

I tried once before to port my <a href="https://github.com/dargaCode/PhonebookSearch">Phonebook Search project</a> from vanilla JS over to React, and I wasn’t able to get it working.

The approach I took back then was to take my finished fished project and start trying to stuff React code into it. This time I tackled it from scratch, building the UI components from the bottom up, and it worked out much better.

This was the first time I’ve used React outside of my job, which meant I also had to learn how to do ostensibly-basic things like build my code and deploy it to a GitHub page.
