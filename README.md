<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS+React</strong>

I tried once before to port my <a href="https://github.com/dargaCode/PhonebookSearch">Phonebook Search project</a> from vanilla JS over to React, and I wasn’t able to get it working.

The approach I took back then was to take my finished fished project and start trying to stuff React code into it. This time I tackled it from scratch, building the UI components from the bottom up, and it worked out much better.

As I was building all of the UI elements, I ended up discovering a lot more edgecases, functionality, and polish that I wanted to add, which was very satisfying. 

This was the first time I’ve used React outside of my job, which meant I also had to learn how to do ostensibly-basic things like build my code and deploy it to a GitHub page.
